# Computer-Graphic-and-Visualization
I approach designing software by looking at all of the proper directions and protocols and designing accordingly. Adding texture, color, and rotations to 3D scenes has been new design skills that I have discovered that has helped me with this project! I have followed all of the directions and videos to help me on this project. If I ever have to make 3D objects in the future, in a 3D scene, I always have this project and course to refrence back to. Applying more in line comments, is what I have applied while working on this project. This has helped me stay more organized. My approach to developing this code thoughout the Milestones has helped me to stay organized and to ensure that all of the code is correct within my Milestones prior to moving forward to the other assignments. I have a gotten better and more comfortable with my coding skills, in which led me to the completion of this project. This course has helped me to become a more organized programmer, becausse when your are using computer graphics and visualizations, you must be organized in order to understand it what you are coding fully. With the skills and knowledge that I have learned in this course, I feel that I could go easily work at DreamWorks and use that as a professional pathway!
